##Welcome to The Vision Board, an online tool to help users accomplish their dreams

####In development by Chris Thompson

You can find this project live at
https://visionboard.herokuapp.com/

##What we created
####My goal was to create an online version of a vision board.  A vision board is a 'board' with pictures of things and ideas that you want to acquire.  
####My online version allows users to create one using photos from the Internet or photos from a file, accessing their boards securely with an account from an email address or from their Facebook account. They can then share their boards with people that are not members of the site.

##Suggested Features should we soldier on
* Report an offensive picture
    Maybe a drag and drop to field which sends to Admin screen for review
* Create a Facebook story for sharing vision boards.
